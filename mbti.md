 ## Button Functionality:
On the Home page, a button labeled "Register New Color" allows users to interact with the site by redirecting them to a new page (new.html). This showcases smooth navigation and enhances user interaction.
 ## Hover Effect:
Interactive elements, such as buttons, feature a hover effect that applies a bold accent color to draw attention. This feedback improves usability by visually indicating which elements are interactive.
## Back Navigation:
On the new.html page, an X button is available in the top-right corner. When users click the X button, they are seamlessly redirected back to the Home page (index.html), ensuring smooth and intuitive navigation.
## Layout Design:
The webpage layout leverages CSS Grid for structured rows and columns and Flexbox for aligning and spacing elements within containers. This ensures a clean, responsive design across various screen sizes.
